# Tactical Trend Trader (3T) - v0.1.0 Release Review & Backlog

This document synthesizes findings from a thorough review of the v0.1.0 release, incorporating existing roadmap items and known open issues.

## 📋 Synthesized Backlog (Open Items)

This list combines items from the official Roadmap, active development branches, and the v0.1.0 review.

### 🚨 Known Active Issues
- [ ] **Issue #13**: Fix Proxy Failover logic in Order Gateway.
- [ ] **Issue #4**: Fix CI/CD pipeline failures (GitHub Actions).
- [ ] **GEM-5**: Implement Take Profit Resilience (handling restarts during TP events).

### 🛠 Refinement & Tech Debt
- [ ] **Database Initialization**: Refine `init.sql` to avoid destructive `DROP TABLE` calls on accidental re-runs, while maintaining schema integrity.
- [ ] **Clonal Adaptation**: Refine evolutionary search parameters based on `analyze_ann_params.py` findings.
- [ ] **Risk Model**: Implement the "Risk Model Money Management" allocation logic (from feature branch).

### 🚀 Feature Roadmap
- [ ] **Expanded Exchange Support**: Add support beyond HyperLiquid (Binance, Bybit).
- [ ] **Advanced Analytics**: Integrate ML models for signal filtering (Regime detection).
- [ ] **Real-time Portfolio Management**: Enhanced dashboard for multi-account tracking.

## 🔍 System Review & Design Verification

The following items were identified during review and confirmed as intentional design choices for v0.1.0:

### Order Execution (Maker-Only)
*   **Design Choice**: The Order Gateway utilizes `Post-Only` (`Alo`) limit orders to avoid excessive taker fees.
*   **Verification**: `order_gateway.py` correctly implements this strategy to ensure trades only execute as makers.

### Market Hours & Rest
*   **Design Choice**: The system enforces rest periods (Vatican City time) via `is_market_open()`.
*   **Verification**: During these periods, the Reconciliation Engine remains static, while safety mechanisms like Take Profit handle emergencies.

### Resource Management & Scalability
*   **Design Choice**: MySQL connection management is optimized for large-scale worker pools (up to 12k+ workers) by avoiding library-level pooling and centralizing via Celery queues to prevent database thrashing.
*   **Verification**: Observability sampling is aggressively configured (`0.00000001`) to maintain performance at extreme telemetry volumes.
