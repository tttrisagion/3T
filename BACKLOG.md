# Tactical Trend Trader (3T) - v0.1.0 Release Review & Backlog

This document synthesizes findings from the v0.1.0 release review and consolidates them into actionable "tickets" for the next phase of development.

## 📋 Open Tickets & Tasks

### [3T-001] Prediction Models & Regime Detection Expansion
**Description**: Revisit the earlier work cited in `trisagion.tex` regarding the bootstrap-aggregated ensemble of heterogeneous learners (MLP, LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, etc.).
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Evaluate a hybrid approach: Use lightweight predictive models to complement the online stochastic optimization engine.
- [ ] Implement Hurst processes to complement existing Permutation Entropy thresholds.
- [ ] Research correlation between market oscillation and system maximum adverse excursions (MAE).
**Context**: This is a broad expansion of the "Clonal Adaptation" and "Regime Detection" items, moving beyond simple signal filtering to robust market state classification.

### [3T-002] Multi-Terminal Exchange Support (FIX & IB)
**Description**: Pivot exchange support focus from retail crypto APIs to institutional-grade interfaces.
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement support for **FIX Protocol** (Financial Information eXchange).
- [ ] Implement support for **Interactive Brokers (IBKR) API**.
**Note**: Retail crypto exchanges (Binance, Bybit) are deprioritized in favor of FIX/IB.

### [3T-003] Database Initialization Safety Refinement
**Description**: The current `init.sql` is destructive (`DROP TABLE IF EXISTS`).
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Refine the database initialization process to prevent accidental data loss while maintaining schema integrity for fresh deployments.

### [3T-004] Order Gateway: Issue #13 (Proxy Failover)
**Description**: Address the bug where proxy failover is not operating correctly on the order gateway.
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Fix logic in `order_gateway.py` to ensure reliable failover across the configured proxy list.

### [3T-005] CI/CD Infrastructure: Issue #4 (Fix Failures)
**Description**: Resolve persistent failures in GitHub Actions workflows.
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Debug and fix CI/CD pipeline in `.github/workflows/`.

### [3T-006] Providence Engine: GEM-5 (Take Profit Resilience)
**Description**: Ensure take-profit events are resilient to system restarts.
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement state persistence/resumption logic for TP events to prevent "stuck" positions or lost gains during crashes.

## 🔍 Design Verification (Closed/Intentional)

The following items were audited and verified as **intended behavior** for v0.1.0:

*   **Maker-Only Execution**: The use of `limit` + `Alo` (Post-Only) in `order_gateway.py` is an intentional design choice to avoid excessive taker fees.
*   **Rest Periods**: The hardcoded market hours (Vatican City time) in `reconciliation_engine.py` are intentional "times of rest" for the system.
*   **MySQL Strategy**: Direct connections and centralized Celery queuing are intentional to avoid thrashing/pooling overhead at a scale of 12,000+ workers.
*   **Observability Sampling**: The aggressive sampling rate (`0.00000001`) is a necessary performance constraint for extreme telemetry volumes.
*   **Manual Migrations**: The project favors manual SQL updates over the complexity of migration tools for the current development phase.
